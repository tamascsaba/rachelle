## Usage
You can simply use this project as a drop-in replacement for any TypeScript projects if you need something fast, and lightweight. Just replace the `./src` and `./test` folder and it should work right out of the box.

Both `Travis CI` and `Circle CI` are supported.

## Coverage reports

The coverage reports are generated with `Istanbul`, and delivered to `coveralls.io` and `codecov` by `Travis CI`.

Istanbul generate a 100% correct coverage report. See the source and test files and do a comparison.

## FAQ

#### How to use this boilerplate with Karma?

NPM install the `Karma` package and type `karma init` on the command line. The test files are pre-transpilled by `TypeScript` and located here `build/test/specs/**/*.js`.
Install a `Karma` preprocessor, and the NPM packages you may need.

#### Is JSX supported?

Yes. Both `TSX` and `JSX`. By default `Bublé` are configured to be used with `React`. You may change this inside the `rollup.config.js` file.

#### Why is everything so strict?

What do you mean? The `TypeScript` compiler have it's rules to follow, as well as `TSLint`. Everytime you bundle, run a watch task or
run the unit tests, things get validated. You can't compile the source code or run unit tests if there are errors in your code.

#### When should I consider using this boilerplate?

You may consider this is if you need a lightweight, fast boilerplate that export a single file.

#### What's the browser compatibility?

As a rule of thumb, `TypeScript` works best in `IE9` and above.

#### Do I need to customize this boilerplate?

Nope. You only have to change the name on the boilerplate in the `package.json`.
